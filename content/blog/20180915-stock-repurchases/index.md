title: "Do Stock Repurchases Increase Future Returns?"
author: Dan Rogers
description: >
  We examine a set of 167 stocks that announced stock repurchase programs
  in the past year.  On average, we see that these stocks increased in value
  by 5% after 50 days and 10-15% after 90 days (2.5% and 7.5% on a
  market-adjusted basis).  This implies that buying stocks quickly after they
  announce a repurchase program could be a valuable strategy.

## Overview

The attached paper looks at companies that announced stock repurchases to see how these activities affected the stock price.  167 stocks were examined.  While their individual returns look like a bunch of spaghetti:

The average returns over these stocks actually do show a good trend:

On average, stocks fall about 5% before the repurchase is announced.  (This makes sense because companies will want to buy back their stock only if it is trading less than what they believe is a fair value.)  After the repurchase is announced, the stock tends to increase 5% after 50 days and a 10-15% return after 90 days (2.5% and 7.5% on a market-adjusted basis).

Looking for stock repurchase announcements and buying those stocks could prove to be a valuable strategy.

title: Modeling Stock Returns and Pricing Options
author: Dan Rogers
description: >
  A t-distribution and a "split" t-distribution are shown to be good models
  for stock returns.  A distribution is fit to real-world data and used to
  infer theoretical prices for call and put options.  These theoretical prices
  are compared to market prices and differences are discussed.

## Overview

The attached paper looks at different distributions that can be used to model a stock's returns.  The normal distribution, t-distribution, cauchy distribution, and logistic distributions are compared, and the t-distribution is shown to be superior.  We also look at using a "split" t-distribution where we model the upside and the downside using different parameters to capture their unique shapes and show how this improves fits in many cases.

The distributions are then used to predict option prices.  The predicted prices are compared with market prices and differences are discussed.

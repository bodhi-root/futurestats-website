  A cool site to generate "favicon.ico" files for your website.

Once again, I noticed that one of my websites (this one actually) had been built using a default "favicon".  I went searching for some other icon I could steal but ended up coming across this site: https://favicon.io/.  In addition to transforming more common image types to ".ico" files, the "Generate" section of this site allows you to quickly generate a text-based icon by specifying the text, font, size, color, and background color. With little fuss I generated a new icon for this website:

![Icon](android-chrome-192x192.png)

This was generated with the settings:

- Text: FS
- Background: Rounded
- Font: Coda
- Font Size: 90
- Font Color: ```#FFF```
- Background Color: ```#228```

Clicking "Download" downloads a zip folder containing:

- favicon.ico
- facicon-16x16.png
- favicon-32x32.png
- apple-touch-icon.png
- android-chrome-192x192.png
- android-chrome-512x512.png

Everything you would need not only to create a simple "favicon" for the browser but also the home page icons used on iPhone and Android phones.

What a cool site!  I'm going to have to remember this one.
